PROGRAM 1
Aim:
To write a C++ program to perform bitwise operations (AND, OR, NOT, XOR, left shift, and right shift) on two integer values.

Tools Used:

Programiz (Online C++ compiler)

Visual Studio Code (with C++ extension and GCC compiler)

Theory:
Bitwise operators in C++ operate on binary representations of integers. These operators are used in low-level programming, embedded systems, and optimization.

The main bitwise operators are:

& (AND): Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1

| (OR): Sets each bit to 1 if at least one of the bits is 1

~ (NOT): Inverts all bits

^ (XOR): Sets each bit to 1 only if one of the bits is 1

<< (Left Shift): Shifts bits to the left by a specified number of positions, multiplying the number

>> (Right Shift): Shifts bits to the right, dividing the number

Algorithm:

1.Start the program.

2.Declare two integer variables and initialize them with values.

3.Perform the following operations:

4.Bitwise AND

5.Bitwise OR

6.Bitwise NOT on both numbers

7.Bitwise XOR

8.Left and right shifts on both numbers

9.Display the results using cout.

10.End the program.

Conclusion:
The program was successfully executed to demonstrate the use of bitwise operations in C++. It shows how binary manipulation works using C++ operators and is foundational for learning embedded system-level programming and performance optimization technique
